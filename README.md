# typescript-starter

TypeScript starter template with Jest for testing, ESLint for linting, and Winston for logging.

## Prerequisites

This project targets the latest Node.js LTS release. Ensure your environment uses **Node.js 22.x**.

## Running in a Dev Container

1. Install Docker and the VS Code **Dev Containers** extension.
2. Open the command palette and select **Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container...**.
3. VS Code builds the container from `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` and runs `npm install` automatically.

## Running Locally

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
2. Use the npm scripts below to develop, test, and build the project.

## npm Scripts

| Script | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Runs `watch` to rebuild and lint on file changes. |
| `npm start` | Executes the compiled code from `dist/`. |
| `npm run build` | Compiles TypeScript using `tsconfig.build.json`. |
| `npm run build:fast` | Faster, less strict build for development. |
| `npm test` | Runs the Jest test suite. |
| `npm run lint` | Lints the `src/` directory without making changes. |
| `npm run format` | Applies ESLint fixes to the `src/` directory. |
| `npm run check` | Runs `lint` and `build:fast`. |
| `npm run watch` | Runs `check` whenever source files change. |

## Environment Variables

No environment variables are required by default. You can supply your own variables via the shell or a `.env` file and access them with `process.env`.
