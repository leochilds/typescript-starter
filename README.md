# typescript-starter
This is my typescript starter template that includes jest for testing, eslint for linting, winston for logging and has some helpful scripts for dev.

## Development Container

This project includes a [Dev Container](https://containers.dev/) configuration for VS Code. With the Dev Containers extension installed, you can open the repository in a containerized environment with all dependencies pre-installed:

1. Install Docker and the Dev Containers extension.
2. Open the command palette and select **Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container...**.

The container uses the `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/typescript-node:0-22` image and runs `npm install` after creation.

## Prerequisites

This project targets the latest Node.js LTS release. Ensure your environment uses **Node.js 22.19.0 or newer**.
